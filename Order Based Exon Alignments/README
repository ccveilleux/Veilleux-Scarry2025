Fasta alignments of OPN1LW exons 3, 4, and 5 for different taxonomic groups. Sequences for exons 3, 4, and 5 were collected for each species from NCBI Blast or Ensembl.org. For species with multiple genomes, we first selected a representative species genome, then blasted each exon sequence of the species representative genome against the other individual genomes and compared the resulting sequence similarities. Any sequence that differed from the species representative was added to the .fasta alignment for the taxonomic group. Alignments were performed in Geneious Prime using the Geneious alignment tool (v. 1.2.3) with  default settings (automatically determine direction, global alignment with free end gaps, 65% similarity cost matrix, gap open penalty = 12, gap extension penalty = 3, refinement iterations = 2).

For each exon, the sequences are grouped by taxonomic order in the following files: Afrosoricia-Pholidota-Tubulidentata, Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Chiroptera, Dermoptera-Scandentia, Eulipotyphyla-Macroscelidea, Lagomorpha, Perissodactyla, Pilosa-Cingulata, Proboscidea-Sirenia, Hyracoidea, Rodentia. The location of the critical tuning site in this exon for each file is listed in Five_sites_locations_for_order_alignments.xlsx.
